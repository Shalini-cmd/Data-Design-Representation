Give the Ebay Scraping Code a Look, it follows an entire scraping pipeline<br>
- Extract all the URLs from Ebay
- Split the URLs into two text files - one with sponsored listings and another with non-sponsored listings
- Use regex expressions to extract HTML content specific to product details
- Make necessary data type formatting and cleaning
- Simplify categorical variables wherever necessary: for e.g.
-- Changing price from US dollars to cent format. Prices to be inserted as INT
-- Changing Yes/No or True/false columns into binary (1/0) format
-- Treating for missing values and Nan values in the dataset should be changed to NULL
- Create a MySQL database named 'Ebay' and store it in a database table
